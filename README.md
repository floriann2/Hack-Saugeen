# Hack-Saugeen
<b>Inspiration</b>:
People only download mobile apps when they intend to use it often. I was asked to help a team of Hatch employees develop a web-based solution that avoids maintaining multiple different operating systems that a phone may rely on.

<b>What it does</b>:
Identifies the route, location of the trolley, and the direction it's going in (real-time).

<b>How I built it</b>:
Used a combination of front end web technologies (HTML/CSS, JS) and integrated Google Maps API.

<b>Challenges I ran into</b>:
Implementing the Google Maps API into a CMS such as Weebly

<b>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</b>:
Being able to do a freelance project for an engineering consulting company like Hatch.

<b>What I learned</b>:
Many different programming technologies (and web technologies specifically) can work together in interesting ways!

</b>What's next for Hack Saugeen</b>:
Continuous improvement on the web app, so that it can potentially be used in this summer's tourist events.
