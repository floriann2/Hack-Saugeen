# Hack-Saugeen
Inspiration:
People only download mobile apps when they intend to use it often. I was asked to help a team of Hatch employees develop a web-based solution that avoids maintaining multiple different operating systems that a phone may rely on.

What it does:
Identifies the route, location of the trolley, and the direction it's going in (real-time).

How I built it:
Used a combination of front end web technologies (HTML/CSS, JS) and integrated Google Maps API.

Challenges I ran into:
Implementing the Google Maps API into a CMS such as Weebly

Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
Being able to do a freelance project for an engineering consulting company like Hatch.

What I learned:
Many different programming technologies (and web technologies specifically) can work together in interesting ways!

What's next for Hack Saugeen:
Continuous improvement on the web app, so that it can potentially be used in this summer's tourist events.
