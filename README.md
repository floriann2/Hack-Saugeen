# Hack-Saugeen

## Inspiration

People only download mobile apps when they intend to use it often. I was asked to help a team of Hatch employees develop a web-based solution that avoids maintaining multiple different operating systems that a phone may rely on.

## What It Does
Identifies the route, location of the trolley, and the direction it's going in (real-time).

## How I Built It
Used a combination of front end web technologies (HTML/CSS, JS) and integrated Google Maps API.

## Challenges
Implementing the Google Maps API into a CMS such as Weebly

## Accomplishments
Being able to do a freelance project for an engineering consulting company like Hatch.

## What I Learned
Many different programming technologies (and web technologies specifically) can work together in interesting ways!

## What's Next for Hack Saugeen
Continuous improvement on the web app, so that it can potentially be used in this summer's tourist events.
